<b>Story:</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Lockheed Martin hired me out after graduating as an engineer in 2013 into a leadership development program.  
  I changed jobs frequency and traveled the country learning about the Defense Industry & manufacturing.  
  Once I finished the leadership development program, I decided to go a software program to work in operations and customer engagement.
  After working that job for few years, I realized I needed to know more about software for the next step in my career.
  In 2018 I started a Masters degree in Applied Data Science at Syracuse while working full time.
  I learned alot from work, school, and reading articles about the rapidly expanding industry of data.
  As I Graduate in 2020, I look forward to transitioning into a job in the Data Science industry in Analytics and helping Customer have a clearer understanding of their data.
