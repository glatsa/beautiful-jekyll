<b>Story:</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  After graduating college in 2013, I started my career as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and was part of the Operations Leadership Development Program (OLDP). 
  This program allowed me to move around the country working in different business areas, which helped me learn about the defense industry and manufacturing. 
  Once I completed OLDP, I became a Systems Engineer working in operations and customer engagement for a software program. 
  After several years in this role, I found I needed to know more about software to advance in my career. 
  In 2018, I started my Master of Applied Data Science degree at Syracuse University, while continuing my full-time job at Lockheed. 
  Through my work and studies, I deepened my learning and understanding of the rapidly expanding data industry. 
  As a 2020 graduate, I look forward to transitioning to the data science industry to help customers have more clarity around their data.
