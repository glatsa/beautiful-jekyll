      One of the things that drew me to data science initially was learning about [Quantitative Investing].  I'd like to learn about how to do [Financial Analysis] with the goal to explore algorithmic trading.

       One of the things that drew me to data science initially was learning about quantitative investing. I’d like to learn how to do [Time-Series Analysis] with the goal to explore  [Streaming Data].

      During my Advance Database course, we spent time reviewing several different database technologies. I found this intriguing because I finally understood how to set up an environment and remotely access it. This is a valuable skill to help me set up a [Home Server] for personal projects and to create a Personal Development Environment. Now, I need to purchase the hardware and start to play with it.

      I’ve played a little bit with animated graphics/motion graphics, but they are only be a few seconds long (see above and [see code]). I aspire to tell [Data Stories] through [Videos].  This skill would help me develop short videos for personal projects on social media and for professional communication and marketing.
