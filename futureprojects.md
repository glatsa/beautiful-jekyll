      One of the reasons I got into Data Science was learning about [Quantitative Investing].  I'd like to learn about how to do [Financial Analysis] in hope I can explore more about algorithimic trading.

### Time Series Analysis

      Most of the data I've used has been with fixed data that isn't streaming.  Therefore, this is a gap in my experience.To get better at interacting with streaming data, I need to first learn about [Time-Series Analysis], and then I'll be have a better foundation to learn about [Streaming Data].

### Setting Up A Home Server

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      During my Advance Database course, we spent time reviewing several different Database Technologies.  This intrigued me, becuase I finally understood how to set up an environment and be able to remotely access this.  I wanted this skill because it could help me set up a [Home Server] for personal hobbies projects but also help me create a Personal Development Environment.  Now I actually need to buy the hardware and start to play with it.

### Motion Graphics

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I've played alittle bit with animated graphics/motion graphics, but they have only be a few seconds long (see above & [see code]). I aspire to tell [Data Stories] through [Videos].  This skill would help me develop short videos for personal projects on social media and for professional communication/marketing.
